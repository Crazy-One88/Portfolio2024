              <p><span>Pokémon Card Trading Centre</span></p>
              <p>
                This project started as a school assignment, where I dived into creating a cool desktop design for a trading platform. I wanted to make it super easy for folks to trade Pokémon cards, so I picked the Pokémon universe as my inspiration. The goal was straightforward: make card trading a breeze — find, view, and swap cards hassle-free.
              </p>

              <br>
               
              <p><span>Project Overview:</span></p>
                <p>
                  Pokestop is dedicated to making card trading effortlessly delightful for the Pokémon community. I focused on creating a desktop version that's not only easy on the eyes but also super user-friendly, making it particularly appealing for our target audience. Think organized cards, detailed views, and a slick system for swapping.              </p>

                <p>
                  In this phase, we're deep into the Pokestop world, specifically exploring the sitemap and flowchart. Here, I showcase the essential pages and guide the user through the card-trading journey. The focus is on what works well and what might hit a snag — for instance, the challenges users face in sending or meeting up for trades, making the process less attractive or reliable. Even though we're keeping it simple with just two screens for the assignment, we're peeling back the layers to understand every step the user takes in swapping Pokémon cards.                  <br>

            <h2 class="section-title details">▐	Wireframing and concepting</h2>

            <p><span>Landing Page:</span></p>
            <p>
              On the landing page, we played around with where to put the filter menu. After a bit of experimenting, we settled on a side panel on the left – easy for users to spot and use. The navigation tabs got a little makeover too, adding a dash of freshness to the usual setup.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><span>Detail Page:</span></p>
          <p>
            Now, peek into the detail page, where we figured out the best spots for info around the Pokémon card pic. We kept it user-friendly, and surprise, we decided to keep the filter menu. Not for filtering, but to show which filters are on the current card. Sneaky, right?

            In these drafts, every line has a purpose, making sure Pokestop not only looks good but also feels smooth for anyone diving in.

              <p><span>Evolution from Wireframe:</span></p>
              <p>
                Here, we play with real options for dropdowns, filter side menus, and a handy button guiding users to the next step. Learning from past rounds, we've made tweaks to enhance user experience, bringing the design closer to what users might encounter in the final version.              </p>
              <br>
              <p><span>User-Centric Refinements:</span></p>
            <p>
              Taking heed of feedback, we rethought the placement of elements on the homepage. Now, the search bar takes center stage, and some filter options are in the same section as the cards, making it easier for users to find what they need. The question of how users can choose who's selling or seeking cards led us to thoughtful adjustments, making the decision-making process more intuitive.

            <p>
              
            crafting three distinct side panel concepts for the homepage. Each concept delved into different ways of presenting options and filters, exploring numerical dropdowns, sliders, radio buttons, checkboxes, and even image-based selection through swiping.        </p>   
            
               <br>

            <p><span>User-Friendly Element Selection</span></p>
          <p>
            While some elements might dazzle visually, the essence lies in practicality and user-friendliness. Recognizing the importance of simplicity and ease of use, I distilled the best from all three concepts. The final side panel design integrates familiar and straightforward elements – sliders for numerical input, radio buttons and checkboxes for filters with multiple options.           </p>

            <br>

           <p><span>Balancing Creativity and Practicality</span></p>
           <p>
            These design decisions aim to make navigation and card exploration on Pokestop seamless and enjoyable, balancing creativity with practicality.

              <p><span>Final Touch: Detail Page for Pokémon Card</span></p>
            <p>
              
              In the final rendition, every element carefully extracted from the wireframe paints a clear picture of the Pokémon card's details. Notably, the filters are strategically placed in the left side panel, keeping the card information uncluttered and user-friendly.            
            </p>
               <br>
          <p>
            Addressing feedback, the seller's prominence has been minimized to the top right, ensuring a more balanced visual hierarchy. Users can now easily absorb all information about the card and initiate actions, such as saving or trading, with a single, user-friendly button. This refined design enhances the overall user experience, offering a harmonious blend of accessibility and visual appeal.

              Dear User,
              <br>
              Apologies for the scrolling exercise! We know, we know, it's a bit of a workout, but good things come to those who scroll, right? 😄 Now, let's dive into the nitty-gritty of the final homepage image. 
              </p>            <br>
            <p>
              Behold the final homepage screen, where the marriage of wireframe and concept has worked its magic! The search bar, per your insightful feedback, now cozies up snugly in the card panel. The filter options, boldly distinct from the card choices in the side panel, are a visual delight. Not only is it a breeze to search for cards, but it's also a visually captivating experience
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><span>Reflection</span></p>
            <p>
              Reflecting on the journey, I might have veered off the "less stylistic" road for the assignment, but hey, challenges are my jam! I'm genuinely proud of this design. Crafting options and filters was a fantastic learning curve, especially pondering on placements and their impact on the user. It's safe to say I'll approach search/filter functionalities differently in the future, thanks to the valuable lessons learned!
