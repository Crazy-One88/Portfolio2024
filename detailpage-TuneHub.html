              <p><span>Introducing Tunehub</span></p>
              <p>
                 My innovative dating and meetup app tailored for music enthusiasts! Similar to Tinder, but with a unique twist. This isn't just about matching people; it's about planning real-world activities. Users create profiles, link them to Spotify (or manually select their favorite music during sign-up), and as they swipe through profiles, they not only encounter potential matches but also questions about events and music. Upon mutual interest, an event is automatically created, giving you and your match a pre-planned activity.  
                    </p>

                    <p><span>Over-sensitivity features</span></p>
                    <p>
                       But that's not all! To ensure Tunehub is inclusive, I've added special features for individuals with sensory sensitivities. For example, users can check the sensory stimuli levels and their locations before attending an event. Additionally, during a silent disco, they can adjust sound or music settings through the app. Tunehub, where a love for music fosters genuine connections! üé∂

              <p><span>Meet my Persona</span></p>
              <p>
                Meet Lantijn, my assigned classmate for this project. Lantijn is a young man with a passion for music and meeting new people, but he grapples with overstimulation sensitivity. His challenge often lies in transitioning from online connections to real-life meetups.
              </p>
<br>
              <p><span>Lantijn's Desires:</span></p>
              <p>
                Lantijn seeks to connect with people who share his specific music tastes. He's not interested in superficial connections; instead, he desires to engage with individuals who appreciate the same artists and genres on a deeper level. He believes that people with identical music preferences also share similar thoughts and values. For Lantijn, this shared musical passion lays the foundation for meaningful and profound conversations.              </p>
<br>
              <p><span>Designing for Lantijn:</span></p>
              <p>
                In crafting the app, my goal was to cater to Lantijn's preferences. The application needed to go beyond just matching users; it had to facilitate connections based on specific musical interests. The emphasis was on creating opportunities for genuine interactions and ensuring that once matched, users like Lantijn could easily transition from online connections to real-world activities.

          <p><span>First Wireframes</span></p>
          <p>
            Here are some concepts showing the different screens I've been working on. I tried out various designs to figure out what works best for Lantijn. No fancy design inspirations here ‚Äì just practical solutions based on what Lantijn needs and what I found in my research.          </p>
          <br>
          <p><span>Design Philosophy:</span></p>
        <p>
          I looked into dating and music apps to see what makes them easy to use. I found that people are more likely to use an app that feels similar to one they already know, like Spotify. So, I focused on designing something familiar to make it user-friendly.  
         </p>
<br>
         <p><span>Not Just Swiping: Talking to Meet:</span></p>
         <p>
          I wanted to find a way for people to meet without the usual swiping. So, I added question cards and conversation starters. These can be used when meeting someone in person or added to your profile. They help when you're face-to-face and need something to talk about.

                  <p>
                    I've brainstormed a new feature to make the app less overwhelming for users like Lantijn who are sensitive to
                    stimuli in crowded places. It can be tough to control sensory input at festivals or events, so here's what I've
                    come up with: </p>
                  <br>
                  <p><span>Sensory Awareness:</span></p>
                  <p>
                    Now, users can check the sensory information for any event by clicking on its details. This feature lets them know
                    where there might be a lot of stimuli ‚Äì be it noise, lights, or crowds. The location feature also helps users find
                    quieter spots within the current event, allowing them to move away from crowded areas.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p><span>Restful Spaces:</span></p>
                  <p>
                    To enhance the sensory-friendly aspect, each event now includes a designated rest area marked with a yin-yang
                    icon. This indicates the best spot to take a break at the event, ensuring users have a quiet and calm space. </p>
              
                  <p><span>Music Control:</span></p>
                  <p>
                    I've added a new tab in the navigation bar called "Music Control/Layer." This allows users, especially at
                    headphone-centric events like silent discos, to adjust volume, pause, play, skip tracks, or even switch music
                    channels. Giving users more control over their auditory experience enhances their overall comfort during events.

              <p>
                During the swiping process, users not only encounter profiles but also question cards. These cards inquire about
                artists, events, festivals, etc. If both users like or dislike the same questions, it increases the likelihood of a
                match.

              <p><span>Matched Users Event Creation:</span></p>
              <p>
                Upon a successful match, the app doesn't immediately reveal the match. Instead, it automatically generates an event
                comprising all users who share common interests and have matched.
              </p>
              
              <p><span>Event Invitation:</span></p>
              <p>
                The app then prompts the user, asking if they'd like to attend an event with the matched users. If agreed, this event
                is automatically added to the user's planned events.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>This approach aims to seamlessly transition from digital connections to real-world interactions, fostering genuine
                connections based on shared interests. It enhances the user experience by adding a layer of spontaneity to event

              <p>
            
                In crafting the final product poster for the Tunehub app, I've embarked on an intriguing and enjoyable journey. Designing with consideration for individuals with limitations posed its challenges, yet it proved to be a rewarding and enlightening experience. Learning to navigate the complexities of inclusivity has not only expanded my skill set but also altered my perspective on design.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Addressing the needs of individuals with sensitivities was not always straightforward, but the challenge has been both insightful and invigorating. Moving forward, I'm committed to incorporating such considerations from the outset of my design processes, recognizing the importance of inclusivity in creating impactful and user-centric solutions.

              <p>
                This project has been a personal growth experience, showcasing my evolving capabilities and adaptability. While some may have found this task less enjoyable, I've relished the opportunity to delve into a project that not only challenged me but brought me a sense of fulfillment and enjoyment. Looking back, I am pleased with the outcome and eager to apply the lessons learned in future endeavors.
